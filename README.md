#Dragon Book Appendix A Compiler
Starting to implement the Compiler of the [Dragon Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools), which can be found in Appendix A.

Roadmap: While working through the book I will stick to the implementation in the book. When I feel ready, I'll start with the back-end.
